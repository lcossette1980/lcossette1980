## AI Automation Architect | Strategy to Production | Public Sector & Enterprise GenAI

**I define the AI strategy, then write the code** — a rare combination that closes the gap between GenAI's potential and operational reality.

As the sole AI automation engineer for Multnomah County, I own the full lifecycle: problem discovery, stakeholder alignment, architecture, code, deployment, and change management. Previously spearheaded USAA Bank's first enterprise AI & Data Strategy across a $126B portfolio. 20-year military career culminating at E-9 (top 1%). PhD candidate. Published researcher. I build production agentic systems and teach executives at UT Austin and Johns Hopkins how to lead with AI.

### What I Ship

**Agentic Systems & Multi-Agent Orchestration**
Production hub-and-spoke architectures, multi-agent pipelines (CrewAI, LangGraph, Google ADK, MCP), function-calling with human-in-the-loop approval, checkpoint/resume fault tolerance. Not prototypes — systems running unattended in government production environments.

**RAG & LLM Engineering**
Vertex AI Vector Search, retrieval pipelines across 56K+ documents, fine-tuned LLMs with custom training pipelines, prompt engineering at scale. Models in production: Gemini, Claude, GPT, Mistral.

**Full-Stack & Cloud Infrastructure**
Python, PHP, React, FastAPI, Drupal 10 — whatever the problem needs. GCP (Cloud Run, BigQuery, Vertex AI), Azure, AWS. Docker, Terraform, CI/CD. Serverless microservices bridging legacy systems to modern AI.

### Production Projects

**WCAG Compliance Engine** — Python, PyMySQL, BeautifulSoup, PDF Analysis
Six-stage automated triage pipeline replacing 4,000–12,000 hours of manual classification. Web crawl uncovered 4,265 "false orphans" invisible to the CMS. 30-minute weekly delta updates replaced monthly re-audits.

**WCAG Remediation Platform** — Python, LangGraph, Gemini 2.5, Claude, Vertex AI, Document AI
End-to-end compliance platform: 9-module diagnostic layer (readability, heading validation, PII detection) feeding 6 remediation agents. Outputs accessible HTML, PDF/UA, and Drupal Webforms.

**Content Automation (Linkit)** — PHP, Drupal 10, Vertex AI, Multi-Agent Architecture
Four specialized agents making 20,000+ government pages translation-ready. Link conversion (32K internal links), address/contact protection, orchestration with checkpoint/resume fault tolerance.

**AI Commander (Agentic RAG)** — Python, Vertex AI, RAG, Streamlit
Hub-and-spoke orchestration: 5 specialized agents with sticky routing, function-calling pipelines, exponential backoff, audit logging, and dynamic visualizations across 56K+ documents.

**AIRS** — React, Azure OpenAI, FastAPI, PyTorch
LLM-powered academic reading coach serving 500+ students. Fine-tuning pipeline with synthetic training datasets. Real-time chat with Azure OpenAI integration.
